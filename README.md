# hcproxy
**hcproxy** is a lightweight forward HTTP proxy that implements just one HTTP method -- `CONNECT`.

With decent network drivers tunneling is zero copy, which makes `hcproxy` fast and efficient. The price for this is 6 file descriptors per connection (client socket, server socket and two pipes).

## Requirements

*  To compile: C++17 compiler.
*  To run: Linux, `libc`.
*  To run as daemon: `systemd`.

## Compiling

```shell
git clone git@github.com:romkatv/hcproxy.git
cd hcproxy
make
```

## Installing locally

Install `hcproxy` as a `systemd` service:
```shell
sudo make install
```

Verify that the service is running:
```console
$ systemctl status hcproxy
‚óè hcproxy.service - HTTP CONNECT proxy
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/hcproxy.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2018-07-13 13:02:09 UTC; 30s ago
   ...
```

Try it out:
```console
$ curl -x localhost:8889 https://www.google.com/
<!doctype html>...
```

If you want to fetch an `http` URL (rather than `https`), use `-p` to force `curl` to use `CONNECT` for proxying all traffic:
```console
$ curl -p -x localhost:8889 http://www.google.com/
<!doctype html>...
```

## Installing remotely via SSH

```shell
./install-via-ssh certificate.pem user@12.34.56.78
```

## Configuring

To change configuration, you'll need to modify the source code of `main()` in `hcproxy.cc` and recompile. For example, here's how you can change the port on which `hcproxy` listens and the timeout for establishing outgoing connections.

```diff
   hcproxy::Options opt;
+  opt.listen_port = 1234;
+  opt.connect_timeout = std::chrono::seconds(10);
   hcproxy::RunProxy(opt);
```

The list of options, their descriptions and default values can be found in the source code.
